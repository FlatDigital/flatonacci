"""
Flatonacci secuence is a secuence which is result from the same given secuence 
plus the sum of the last 3 numbers of the secuence. 

The challenge is to create a flatonacci function that given a signature returns the first 
n elements - signature included of the so seeded sequence. So, if we are to 
start our Flatonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature) and n = 8,
we have this sequence:

[1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31]

Another example; if signature is the secuence [0, 0, 1] we should get some thing
like:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...]

- Signature will always contain 3 numbers 
- n will always be a non-negative number
- if n == 0, then return an empty list and be ready for anything else which is not
clearly specified ;)

Note. Please note that we are gonna test the funcion against a lot of different signatures and n's
